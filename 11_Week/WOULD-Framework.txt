To Build a small, two-player console game that has its roots in the game Battleship from Mattel.
There will be 25-spot grid (A1-E5). Each Player will place five pegs on the board to represent
their five ships. Players will then then take turns firing on their opponent's ships. The first
person to sink all five ships wins.
