We have been commissioned to create a hotel 
management application. We need a web portal that
allows people to book an available room. We also need a 
desktop app for when they check in

We need to create a minimum via product (MVP) that 
will allow the customer to get going and to identify
what features should be added later.




W - Walk Through the project

Hotel Management App
Web Portal
  Allow guests to book rooms
  We have to know if rooms are available

Desktop App
  The guest will check in via desktop app
  We need to be able to look up guest reservation by name or other piece of information

This is an MVP


O - Open up the requirements

Things For Mvp
 ASP.NET Core Razor Pages
Web page - Searching for a room
	Start Data 
	End Date 
	Display list of hotem room types are available
	User can choose to book
 Web page - Book room
	Takes room from search page 
	Ask for Guest Info(name)
	Book upon submission
WPF Core DesktopApp
WPF page - Search for user
	Search by last name and use today's data
	Display a list of matching reservations
	Have a button that checks in a guest
SQL Server data storage 




Things for a future version
 Authenticate guests
 Guest history
 Multiple hotel capabilites 
 Allow guests to check out
 Allow booking search by reservation number or other pieces of information 
 Allow data to be store in other database type like SQLite 


Assumptions that were confirmed 
 One hotel only 
 Guest book a hotel room type, not a specific room
 A hotel employee will check guests in 
 Booking search is done by last name
 Check in means we just mark that they are at hotel
 Data will be stored in SQL Server
 No API middle layer 
 Use the lastest .NET technologies

U - User interface design

L - Logic design

D - Data design
