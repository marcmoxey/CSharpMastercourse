We have been commissioned to create a hotel 
management application. We need a web portal that
allows people to book an available room. We also need a 
desktop app for when they check in

We need to create a minimum via product (MVP) that 
will allow the customer to get going and to identify
what features should be added later.

W - Walk Through the project

How the payment process gonna work?
Do user pick a timeframe when booking?
Are there differnt type of rooms?
Do employees look up user's name to check the user?
Do employees have list of avaiable and booked rooms? 

--------------------------------------------------------

Hotel Management App
Web Portal
  Allow guests to book rooms
  We have to know if rooms are available

Desktop App
  The guest will check in via desktop app
  We need to be able to look up guest reservation by name or other piece of information

This is an MVP


O - Open up the requirements

User Select a timeframe when they want to book the room
User search for the creatia of the room they want
User books an available room 
User pays for room
User goes to front desk to check
Employee searches user name to check the user in.
